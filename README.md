# My-iPhone-16.6-IPA-Archive
Using the power of Trollstore, I can decrypt IPA from the app store with ease. This repository serve as an archive for those IPA.
Noted that this mainly for *offline* games only. I have little interest in uploading IPA of apps like youtube or spotify.

# How is this possible?
"TrollStore is a permasigned jailed app that can permanently install any IPA you open in it.

It works because of an AMFI/CoreTrust bug where iOS does not correctly verify code signatures of binaries in which there are multiple signers.

Supported versions: 14.0 beta 2 - 16.6.1, 16.7 RC (20H18), 17.0" - From the Official's Trollstore repository

In short, I can sideload any ipa file without an Apple Dev account to sign the app, nor do i have the 3 app limit/ 7 day refresh procdeure needed to continue to use the sideloaded app.
With this, I can use various app to: Downgrade app, inject tweak, Change App Bundle ID/metadata, and finally, *Extract and Decrypt IPA files*.

# How safe are these?
As these Ipa comes directly from the Apple Store itself, using my account to "bought stuff" from there, I would say they are mostly safe. Regardless, always download with caution, and put the files through any antivirus you trust if you still have doubt.

# Can you upload XYZ?
Depend on what you're asking for. I'll Never:
- Upload paid games/apps.
- Upload apps with tweaked injected.
- Upload games/apps that I do not own.

If you can garanteed these demand, make a thread over at "Issues" with the title [REQUEST] 

# IPA List
Adding to my cloud repo atp, standby.
