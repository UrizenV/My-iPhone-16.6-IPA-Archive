# My-iPhone-16.6-IPA-Archive
Using the power of Trollstore, I can decrypt IPA from the app store with ease. This repository serve as an archive for those IPA.
Noted that this mainly for *offline* games only. I have little interest in uploading IPA of apps like youtube or spotify.

# How is this possible?
"TrollStore is a permasigned jailed app that can permanently install any IPA you open in it.

It works because of an AMFI/CoreTrust bug where iOS does not correctly verify code signatures of binaries in which there are multiple signers.

Supported versions: 14.0 beta 2 - 16.6.1, 16.7 RC (20H18), 17.0" - From the Official's Trollstore repository

In short, I can sideload any ipa file without an Apple Dev account to sign the app, nor do i have the 3 app limit/ 7 day refresh procdeure needed to continue to use the sideloaded app.
With this, I can use various app to: Downgrade app, inject tweak, Change App Bundle ID/metadata, and finally, *Extract and Decrypt IPA files*.

# Why did I make this?
The purpose of this repository is to document and archive games that are under risks of being delist (as in taken down from the store) in the near future. Some game I have previously played (and some even bought for) have been taken down because the developer are unable to continue provide support for the game, while some other due to unknown purpose entirelly. I believe media should be made available to all until the end of time itself, regardless of whether it can be supported or not. 

# How safe are these?
As these Ipa comes directly from the Apple Store itself, using my own account to accquired games and apps from there, I would say they are mostly safe. Regardless, always download with caution, and put the files through any antivirus you trust if you still have doubt.

# Can you upload XYZ?
Depend on what you're asking for. I'll Never:
- Upload paid games/apps.
- Upload apps with tweaks injected.
- Upload games/apps that I do not own.

If you can garanteed these demand, make a thread over at "Issues" with the title **[REQUEST] + The Name of the Game/app you are requesting**
